# MATLAB-Code-for-Adaptive-Network-Design-Problem
This code is for finding the lower bound solution to the adaptive network design problem (see the paper "Network based Real Option Models", which is a discrete NDP that is updated every time step based on time-variant uncertainties, using an approximate dynamic programming algorithm from real option literature. For large scale implementation, an insertion heuristic was developed (this code). The code was used in this paper: Chow, J.Y.J., Regan, A.C., Ranaiefar, F., Arkhipov, D.I., 2011. A network option portfolio management framework for adaptive transportation planning, Transportation Research Part A 45(8), 765-778. Although the code was customized specifically for the intercity truck network design problem for Iran in that paper, it can be modified to suit urban settings or dynamic traffic assignment variations as well.
